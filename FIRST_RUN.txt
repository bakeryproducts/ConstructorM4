1. Python 3.5 (but should also work on 3.5+) (preferably with conda - https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html)
	conda create -n YOUR_ENV_NAME python=3.5
	

2. conda install (pip install) : 

	scipy		# colorful images for shootings
	matplotlib	# ...
	colour		# armor coloring
	numpy		# ...
	pyqt5		# all interfaces come up from pyqt4 to pyqt5 at march 2019
	pickle		# save/load operations
	pillow		# ...
	glfw 		# includes freeglut
	numpy-stl	# stl files preprocessor
	pyopengl	# graphics
	pyopengl-accelerate
	*those are crusial ones, there can be little more packeges to install, -> run it (3.) and see for yourself

3. RUNNING: from terminal : python ../PATH_TO_CM4/main.py

4. Possible issues:
	1. On windows: pyopengl and pytopengl-accelerate should be installed from binaries at https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/
